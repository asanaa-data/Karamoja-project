# KARAMOJA SUB-REGION CROP (MAIZE & SORGHUM) YIELD ANALYSIS PROJECT by Andrew B. Sana'a

This project uses data collected by Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) in 2017 in order to develop a new food security monitoring tool 
to support the decision making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja.

Karamoja is a sub-region in the north-eastern part pf Uganda in East Africa neighbouring Kenya to the east and South Sudan to the north.
The region is semi-arid and is constantly beset by famine, food shortages, poor crop harvests, droughts and cattle rustling among other
challenges.

The objectives of this project is to visualize the yield of maize and sorghum in the different districts and sub-counties in the region.
The project also aims to look at hidden patterns in the data that may help in decision-making and make targeted solutions
to help improve food security in the region.

The tools used for this exercise are:
Tableau and python programming language.

Results of the initial analysis can be found in the attachments and links below.

* A PowerPoint presentation with a brief of the findings:

* Visualization by tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/a.datasanaa/viz/Karamojacropyieldanalysisproject/Dashboard13)

* and python analysis with pandas

Future work:

* Study and visualize the correlation between the production area and each crop yield at sub-county and district level.

* Study and visualize the correlation between the crop area and each crop at sub-county and district level.

* Explore the correction between the terrain, population and education level and the crop yield in the two administrative levels.

* Explore the crop yield at sub-county level using a map visual.
